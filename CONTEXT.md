# Domain Context

This file names the core concepts used by webdog.ai so future architecture work can talk about the same things consistently.

## Terms

- **Account** — the owner scope for websites, monitors, notification destinations, team members, and stored account-level settings.
- **Managed Deployment** — an operator-run instance where server environment variables provide Context.dev access, Resend delivery, alert postfixing, or monitor limits for all accounts.
- **Website** — a domain being watched. Websites own monitors, snapshots, and alerts.
- **Monitor** — a configured target on a website. A monitor checks site links, page content, or product price data and can be enabled or disabled.
- **Alert** — a persisted change detected by a monitor. Alerts can stay in the dashboard and can also be delivered externally.
- **Notification Destination** — a named outbound route for alerts, such as Slack, email, or webhook.
- **Context.dev Access** — the credential path used for scraping, extraction, screenshots, and brand data. In a Managed Deployment this is server-managed.
- **Email Delivery** — the Resend credential and sender path used for email notification destinations. In a Managed Deployment this can be server-managed.
- **Watch** — a monitor created and managed through the Watcher API (`/api/v1`). It can carry the caller's own end-user id, reference, and metadata, and several watches may target the same page, each with its own baseline.
- **API Client** — a machine credential (API key) for the Watcher API. It acts as the account it was created for.
- **Condition** — an optional rule on a monitor that a detected change must satisfy before it notifies: an AI intent match against the monitor's note, or a deterministic price threshold crossing. Changes that fail it are kept as held alerts.
